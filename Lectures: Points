#Image Augumentation:#
When going through image we deal with the lot of irrelevant information like size. We dont want our model to change the the predition based on size and angle.
Scale Invariance: We dont want size to have effect on predictions
Rotation Invariance: Don't want to change predicition based on angle
To want our deal with rotation invariance and translations invariance by adding new images to data. We expand the data set by data augumentation.
It help to avoid overfitting.
There is an inbuilt image transformation library in Pytorch

#VGG Architecture# :
* 3 by 3 convolutions
* Broken up by 2 By 2 pooling layers
* Finished with 3 fully connected layers

#ResNet #
Kinda like vgg but it is different numbers. They are many more layers. Before this no other architecture manage to have these number of layers.
Super human achievement to classify images in Imagenet database
