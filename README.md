# CNN

INTRODUCTION:
In this tutorial we will walk through Convolutional Neural Network. This tutorial is inspired from the Udacity tutorial on CNN.
Convolutional Neural Network is a special type of deep neural network having alternative convolutional and pooling layers. For most image classification task, CNN are used. Instead of MLP which use fully connected layer, CNN use different layers to detect patters among images which are feed forwarded.
